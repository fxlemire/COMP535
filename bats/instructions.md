HOW TO USE
==========
First, copy `start.bat` into the root folder.

Then, run the file by passing the router number as the first argument.

A list of possible flags to be put after the router number are:
* -c: compile code
* -d: debug mode

E.g. `start.bat 1 -c -d`

_N.B. Make sure the mvn path inside the start.bat is correct._
